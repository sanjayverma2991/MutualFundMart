                                        <p>One should never invest in Mutual Funds, but should invest through them.</p>
                                        <p>To elaborate, we invest in various investment avenues based on our requirements, e.g. for capital growth - we invest in equity shares, for safety of capital and regular income - we buy fixed income products.</p>
                                        <p>The concern for most investors is: how to know which instruments are best for them? One may not have enough abilities, time or interest to conduct the research.</p>
                                        <p>To manage investments, one can outsource certain tasks one is unable to do. Anyone can outsource ‘managing one’s investments’ to a professional firm – the Mutual Fund company. Mutual Funds offer various avenues to fulfill different objectives, which investors can choose from based on one’s unique situation and objective.</p>
                                        <p>Mutual Fund companies manage all administrative activities including paperwork. They also facilitate accounting and reporting the progress of the investment portfolios through a combination of Net Asset Values (NAVs) and the account statements.</p>
                                        <p>Mutual Fund is a great convenience for those who need to invest their money for future requirements. A team of professionals manages the money and the investors can enjoy the fruits of this expertise without getting involved in the mundane tasks.</p>
