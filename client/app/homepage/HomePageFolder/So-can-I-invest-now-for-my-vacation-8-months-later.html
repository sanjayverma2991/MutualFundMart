                    <p>Let us break this myth with an example.</p>
                    <p>Ramesh, a travel junkie got to satisfy his wanderlust, when the company he worked for achieved success and rewarded its employees with bonuses.</p>
                    <p>With his bonus Ramesh decided to go on a Europe trip, but his work on a big and prestigious project was incomplete and approaching its deadline. The project would end in the next eight months.</p>
                    <p>The exact date of Rameshâ€™s trip is yet to be finalized. Looking at his expenses- some money needs to be spent before and some during the trip. Uncertainty regarding the exact dates on which how much money is to be paid is there.</p>
                    <p>Certain Mutual Fund schemes are ideal for such cases.</p>
                    <p>Ideally Ramesh should park these savings into a liquid fund to take them out on any working day. Money will be in his account the day after he submits a request for withdrawal. Ramesh can even request for withdrawal through an SMS or App.</p>
                    <p>Planning for even short term goals becomes convenient with this.</p>
